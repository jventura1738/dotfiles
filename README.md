# dotfiles
Justin's dot files and other config stuff

## What matters:

#### `.vimrc`: 
- this is how i personally like my vim, but i'll admit i use vscode with vim keybindings more
- BTW i reroute my caps lock to esc cuz its easier for me and i never use caps lock

#### `.zshrc`:
- this is just my zsh config nothing really that special

### `terminal_configs`:
- `justin_terminal_clearrr`:
  - this is my main terminal appearance for mac
  - just download and import this: terminal > preferences > (...) bottom left > import > select `justin_terminal_clearrr`
